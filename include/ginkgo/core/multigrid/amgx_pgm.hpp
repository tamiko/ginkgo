/**
 * Iterative refinement (IR) is an iterative method that uses another coarse
 * method to approximate the error of the current solution via the current
 * residual.
 *
 * For any approximation of the solution `solution` to the system `Ax = b`, the
 * residual is defined as: `residual = b - A solution`. The error in
 * `solution`,  `e = x - solution` (with `x` being the exact solution) can be
 * obtained as the solution to the residual equation `Ae = residual`, since `A e
 * = Ax - A solution = b - A solution = residual`. Then, the real solution is
 * computed as `x = solution + e`. Instead of accurately solving the residual
 * equation `Ae = residual`, the solution of the system `e` can be approximated
 * to obtain the approximation `error` using a coarse method `multigrid`, which
 * is used to update `solution`, and the entire process is repeated with the
 * updated `solution`.  This yields the iterative refinement method:
 *
 * ```
 * solution = initial_guess
 * while not converged:
 *     residual = b - A solution
 *     error = multigrid(A, residual)
 *     solution = solution + error
 * ```
 *
 * Assuming that `multigrid` has accuracy `c`, i.e., `| e - error | <= c | e |`,
 * iterative refinement will converge with a convergence rate of `c`. Indeed,
 * from `e - error = x - solution - error = x - solution*` (where `solution*`
 * denotes the value stored in `solution` after the update) and `e = inv(A)
 * residual = inv(A)b - inv(A) A solution = x - solution` it follows that | x -
 * solution* | <= c | x - solution |.
 *
 * Unless otherwise specified via the `multigrid` factory parameter, this
 * implementation uses the identity operator (i.e. the multigrid that
 * approximates the solution of a system Ax = b by setting x := b) as the
 * default inner multigrid. Such a setting results in a relaxation method known
 * as the Richardson iteration with parameter 1, which is guaranteed to converge
 * for matrices whose spectrum is strictly contained within the unit disc around
 * 1 (i.e., all its eigenvalues `lambda` have to satisfy the equation `|lambda -
 * 1| < 1).
